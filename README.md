## üöÄ Project Execution

### Pre-requisites
Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Go](https://go.dev/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We will adopt containerization with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and relational persistence with the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

#### üß≠ Running the application

```bash

# Clone this repository

# Access the project folder via the following terminal
$ cd evys-learning

# Initialize module in Go

# To synchronize code dependencies
$ go mod tidy

# Start and run containers in background
$ docker-compose up -d

# Allows command execution in the bash shell inside the container
$ docker-compose exec postgres bash

# Connect PostgreSQL database server running on local machine using psql command line too
$ psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres

# Create a new Docker network
$ docker network inspect <network name>

# List Docker networks known to Docker running on your system
$ docker network ls

# Connect an existing Docker container to a specific network
$ docker network connect <network name> <container name>

# Run an interactive shell inside an already running Docker container
$ docker exec -it <container name> /bin/sh
```
